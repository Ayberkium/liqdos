The subject of our project is liquid dosing devices and liquid transfer systems at low volume levels (micro/milliliter). This subject is widely used today in microbiology, chemistry, and medical test laboratories to transfer liquids precisely and at the right rates.

In this project our main aim is developing an automatic liquid dosing system that provides the potential to increase the speed of liquid transfer and dosing processes for the laboratory testing field, keeping margins of error lower than today's laboratory liquid transfer and dosing systems, reducing the need for manpower and reducing human-induced errors in the laboratory.

This project was supported within the scope of TÜBİTAK 2209-A projects.

I would like to thank to our advisor Dr. Serkan Doğanay, who contributed greatly to the realization of the project.

Thanks also to my teammates: Ömer Yüce, Kadri Emre Orgun, Haydar Barış Öcal.
